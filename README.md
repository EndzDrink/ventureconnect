# WonderConnect: Social Activity Planner
# üåü Overview
# WonderConnect is a platform designed to connect users through shared real-world activities and adventures. Users can browse a dynamic # feed of activities, view detailed discussions, and easily join events. The application is built using modern React practices and # leverages Firebase for persistent, real-time data management.

# üöÄ Core Features
# Activity Feed: Displays a list of cards summarizing various activities (location, date, category, host).

# User Interactions: Allows authenticated users to Like and Join activities.

# Detail View: Clicking any card opens a detailed view (ActivityDetailDialog) that includes a discussion/comment section.

# Join Workflow: Clicking the "Join Adventure" button opens a form which, upon submission, registers the user's participation in the 
# database.

# Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive interface.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
# Component

# Technology

# Purpose

# Frontend

# React (Functional Components)

# UI development and state management.

# Styling

# Tailwind CSS

# Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive styling.

# Database

# Google Cloud Firestore

# NoSQL database used for real-time data persistence.

# Authentication

# Firebase Auth

# Manages user sessions and provides security context (userId).

# Client

# TypeScript

# Ensures type safety throughout the application.

# üíæ Data Architecture & Persistence
# User interactions are secured and persisted using Firebase Firestore. Data is stored in collections scoped to the application ID and # the user ID for security.

# Participation Data
# When a user joins an activity, a private record is created to track their status. This ensures that participation status (isJoined)  
# is maintained across sessions.

# Collection Path: /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/activity_participants/{activityId}

# Purpose: Stores a simple document indicating that the current user is a participant of a specific activity. This document's 
# existence determines the state of the "Join" button on the card.

# Key Logic
# The ActivityCard component contains core logic to handle Firebase connection and data fetching:

# Initialization: Firebase is initialized immediately on component load using the provided global configuration variables 
# (__firebase_config, __initial_auth_token).

# Status Check: The component uses getDoc to check the status of the participation document to instantly render the "Joined ‚úì" or "Join # Adventure" button.

# Click Prevention: Crucially, event propagation is stopped on the "Join" button to prevent it from accidentally triggering the parent # card's onClick event, which would open the detail dialog.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Application
# This application is designed to run in a secured environment where global variables are injected for Firebase initialization.

# Ensure Firebase Context: The following global variables must be available in the execution environment:

# __app_id

# __firebase_config (JSON string)

# __initial_auth_token (Firebase Custom Auth Token)

# Install Dependencies: (Standard React/Tailwind/Firebase setup assumed)

# Run: Launch the application according to your specific environment's guidelines.
